# code-examples
This is a small example of code written recently for projects

This sample demostrates knowledge in Object Oriented design, Data Structures, different
sorting algorithms, efficiency testing, as well code across different languages.

MIPS-Calculator.s is a MIPS assembly language basic calculator

MIPS-Recursion.s is a MIPS assembly language demonstration of basic recursion

Page Rank Project.cpp demonstrates creating a custom adjacency list to make assignment more efficient than required

Sort Compare.py is the first program I have ever written in python. I extended the assignment by implementing numpy to display the results graphically.  I also extended what was assigned by using an extra file to compare that was significantly larger so as to get a more accurate demonstration of sort time implication as file size increases.
